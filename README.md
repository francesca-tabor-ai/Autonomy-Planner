# Autonomy Planner

## Description

Autonomy Planner is the professional workbench for designing, governing, and validating agentic AI systems. It transforms the ambiguity of natural language product requirements into a deterministic, high-integrity governance framework.

**Policy Synthesis**: Automatically extract structured problem statements, audiences, and risk assessments from unstructured PRDs.

**Graduated Agency**: Define a tiered Autonomy Ladder (L0–L4) with granular permissions, prohibited actions, and specific linguistic constraints.

**Escalation Logic**: Map risk-based triggers—such as confidence thresholds or specific topics—to mandatory human handoffs or system exits.

**Simulated Validation**: Stress-test your governance in a real-time sandbox using AI-generated probes that push system boundaries.

This platform ensures that as AI moves from passive assistants to active agents, it remains within a reliable, auditable, and human-centric operational envelope.
